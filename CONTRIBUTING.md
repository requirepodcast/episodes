# Contributing

This repo is open to your contributions! You can improve the episode notes, links or add some timestamps - we would greatly appreciate any help.

If you'd like to contribute please do the following:

- Find an episode that doesn't yet have timestamps, or is missing some.
- Fork this repo, clone to your machine.
- `npm install` - it is required, as we use `husky` and `prettier` to format markdown files.
- Add your changes.
- Open a pull request.
- Say hello to the world ðŸ‘‹.
- Apply any proposed changes by the maintainers.
- It's merge time, baby! ðŸ˜Ž

> Note that we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before you contributing. Thanks ðŸ¤—.
